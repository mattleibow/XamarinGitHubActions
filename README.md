**The Pandemic Approach to CI for Xamarin Apps with GitHub Actions**

Are you wanting to lockdown the CI for your Xamarin apps? Well, I want to show you how you can flatten the curve of learning with a short intro on building and testing Xamarin apps using GitHub Actions. By adding some disinfectant to your workflow, you can quarantine any viruses before they get merged. They are not going to do any social distancing with your code! And, they are certainly not going to self isolate! You will be able to use GitHub Actions to sanitize any code before it infects the rest of the population. By taking a few precautions, users will say "nature is healing" and give you that 5-star review.
